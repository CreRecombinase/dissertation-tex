  abstract = 	 {This paper presents a general, fully Bayesian framework for sparse supervised-learning problems based on the horseshoe prior. The horseshoe prior is a member of the family of multivariate scale mixtures of normals, and is therefore closely related to widely used approaches for sparse Bayesian learning, including, among others, Laplacian priors (e.g. the LASSO) and Student-t priors (e.g. the relevance vector machine). The advantages of the horseshoe are its robustness at handling unknown sparsity and large outlying signals. These properties are justifed theoretically via a representation theorem and accompanied by comprehensive empirical experiments that compare its performance to benchmark alternatives.}

Theory showing the monotone behaviour of the likelihood and convergence of the algorithm is derived. Many examples are sketched, including missing value situations, applications to grouped, censored or truncated data, finite mixture models, variance component estimation, hyperparameter estimation, iteratively reweighted least squares and factor analysis.},

Founded in 1998, GO has become widely adopted in the life sciences, and its contents are under continual improvement, both in quantity and in quality. Here, we report the major developments of the GO resource during the past two years. Each monthly release of the GO resource is now packaged and given a unique identifier (DOI), enabling GO-based analyses on a specific release to be reproduced in the future. The molecular function ontology has been refactored to better represent the overall activities of gene products, with a focus on transcription regulator activities. Quality assurance efforts have been ramped up to address potentially out-of-date or inaccurate annotations. New evidence codes for high-throughput experiments now enable users to filter out annotations obtained from these sources. GO-CAM, a new framework for representing gene function that is more expressive than standard GO annotations, has been released, and users can now explore the growing repository of these models. We also provide the ‘GO ribbon’ widget for visualizing GO annotations to a gene; the widget can be easily embedded in any web page.}",

  journal =      {CoRR},
  year =         2017,

  abstract =     {In exciting new work, Bertsimas et al. (2016) showed
                  that the classical best subset selection problem in
                  regression modeling can be formulated as a mixed
                  integer optimization (MIO) problem. Using recent
                  advances in MIO algorithms, they demonstrated that
                  best subset selection can now be solved at much
                  larger problem sizes that what was thought possible
                  in the statistics community. They presented
                  empirical comparisons of best subset selection with
                  other popular variable selection procedures, in
                  particular, the lasso and forward stepwise
                  selection. Surprisingly (to us), their simulations
                  suggested that best subset selection consistently
                  outperformed both methods in terms of prediction
                  accuracy. Here we present an expanded set of
                  simulations to shed more light on these comparisons.
                  The summary is roughly as follows: (a) neither best
                  subset selection nor the lasso uniformly dominate
                  the other, with best subset selection generally
                  performing better in high signal-to-noise (SNR)
                  ratio regimes, and the lasso better in low SNR
                  regimes; (b) best subset selection and forward
                  stepwise perform quite similarly throughout; (c) the
                  relaxed lasso (actually, a simplified version of the
                  original relaxed estimator defined in Meinshausen,
                  2007) is the overall winner, performing just about
                  as well as the lasso in low SNR scenarios, and as
                  well as best subset selection in high SNR
                  scenarios.},
